title: "About me and this blog"
---

I'm Neil, a software developer from New Zealand living in Amsterdam.

This blog is mostly for myself -- a log of issues and annoyances I come across that are more trivial to solve than a simple Google search, that I decided to write down somewhere in case I need to solve the issue again. I figured I might as well make this public on the internet because the world is a big place, and if I've had to solve a problem chances are someone else has as well. Who knows?

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/nizmow), [Keybase](https://keybase.io/nizmow) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/houghtonneil/).
